                <b>1.	Overall structure and layout</b>
                The basic layout of the homepage for the website consists of a logo, header, navigation bar, a search box, etc. in the upper sections of the page. In the middle sections, there are some containers displaying some sales under the headings like trending products, special offers, hot deals, top brands, etc. And finally at the bottom of the page there is a footer sections containing copyright statements and some important links related within the website and author contacts.
                <br /><br />The <strong>mind map</strong> of the website summarizes all the necessary aspects related to the ‘Motoritz Autopartz’ website i.e. site objectives, major functions, content, audience, similar sites and site structure. The site objectives of the website may not be limited to what is mentioned in the mind map, rather it can be expanded depending on the audience’s feedback and responses. Furthermore, apart from the list of audience mentioned in the map, the general public is always welcomed to buy from the site which is why one of its future objectives is to sell all the regular products and not only motorcycle accessories.
                <br /><br /><strong>Site structure</strong> lists the name of almost all the components and sections of the website. The first level of the site structure lists all the main headings of the website like navigation bar. These level contains further sections and/or pages like apparel, accessories, etc. thus entering another level into the site structure. While in the website, the webpages are divided according to their respective accessors. The accessors being admins and customers have different signup and login credentials.
